# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
